# Renta4 (R4) Director

Eases the orchestration with the [Renta4 automator](https://github.com/GMaur/r4-automator). A part of [Robot Advisor](https://github.com/RobotAdvisor) (GMaur's Investment Ideas)

The dependencies have been written [API-first][api-first], therefore they're not very usable for a person, but for systems. This project aims to connect the different operations of both services.

Think of this as glue to connect the underlaying building blocks.

**Warning**: this project may be deprecated at any time. It is only a first client to connect to the underlaying services.

## Necessary services

  * [R4 automator](https://github.com/GMaur/r4-automator): connects to the R4 broker to make read and write operations
  * [Robot advisor](https://github.com/GMaur/robot-advisor): make decisions on your investments

## Technical notes

See TECHNICALNOTES.md

## Limitations / Hypotheses

  * This is a CLI application, to be used by a single user that has access to sensitive information. It is the user's (and not the project's) duty to protect that information.

## Scope

### Out of scope

  * This project can only connect to a single broker (currently, r4-automator). It is not expected to comply with the API of any other broker
