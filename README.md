# Renta4 (R4) Director

Eases the orchestration with the [Renta4 automator](https://github.com/GMaur/r4-automator). A part of [Robot Advisor](https://github.com/RobotAdvisor) (GMaur's Investment Ideas)

The dependencies have been written API-first, therefore they're not very usable for a person, but for systems. This project aims to connect the different operations of both services.

Think of this as glue to connect the underlaying building blocks.
